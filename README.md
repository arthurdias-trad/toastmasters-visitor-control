# Toastmasters Avenida Paulista Visitor Control
<br><br>
## Goal

This app will allow the officers at the Avenida Paulista Toastmasters Club to manage the list of members and guests who have access to the meetings. Users will be able to see the current list of members, guests and the full list. The officers will also be able to add or delete members and guests. The final list will be printable as a PDF. The ultimate goal is to automate the sending of the guest list on the day of the meeting, to allow both members and visitors to enter the co-working area.

## Stack
The app will use the Flask framework for its backend. A PostgreSQL database will be used to host user information, as well as the lists of club members and guests. Bootstrap will be used in the CSS front.
